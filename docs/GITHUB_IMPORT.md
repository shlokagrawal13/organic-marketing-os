# GitHub repository and source publication

## v0.5 verified source — 2026-09-27.1

Published billing-foundation source commit `0281511e9113d4bd2470b38529bc30d4f5b14a60` to private `main`. Its complete tree `86454cb7e2aeda0db66f730bdd0b29e93d8aaf38` exactly matches the locally built and tested tree. GitHub Actions run 36305587276 ended `startup_failure` with zero jobs. No native test executed, and the detailed startup reason remains unavailable without authenticated browser access.

## Private repository publication — 2026-09-26.6

Verified v0.4 source was uploaded to https://github.com/shlokagrawal13/organic-marketing-os, private repository ID 1389748509, branch main, source commit 0093dfaa9fd0864a77f8680e51e7b506ea32f15d. All 150 uploaded paths, Git blob hashes and modes match the local checkpoint; tree beb2d18a44759a3bf4afb8e70ea0717c89d54a20. History starts at the independent README commit 40e552455688260db0c878b162535e41bb39bfb6. The unrelated OrganicMarketing project is excluded.

Native CI was triggered by the source commit: https://github.com/shlokagrawal13/organic-marketing-os/actions/runs/36269190288. GitHub returned completed/startup_failure with an empty job list, so no native tests ran. One retry request returned HTTP 403, "This workflow run cannot be retried." Generic local YAML parsing succeeded, but that does not verify GitHub's workflow validation or explain the startup failure. The specific startup reason is still unknown; do not assume a billing, permission or application defect.

The connector cannot expose the relevant startup diagnostics through its supported endpoints. Browser inspection found GitHub signed out and the private run unavailable; secure sign-in is needed to inspect the detailed run error. Preserve the uploaded source and resume this diagnostic after authenticated access. Fix the concrete reported cause, rerun native tests and record real results. Do not mark native verification complete.

This follow-up changes continuation records only. The last source commit above identifies the verified application import; resolve the latest documentation commit from the main ref or git rev-parse HEAD. Source is now maintained in this Git repository; older ZIP checkpoints may be stale. Local Git objects were reconstructed from remote metadata and verified by their exact SHA, and the uploaded tree was independently compared before setting the local main/upstream refs.

Only manifest-listed source/context/evidence files were uploaded. Credentials, actual environment files and runtime databases/media remain excluded. This source repository is not a database/media backup.
